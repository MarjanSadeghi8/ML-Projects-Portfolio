This project explores a breast cancer dataset from Kaggle to understand which clinical and demographic factors influence patient survival outcomes. Our goal is to identify meaningful predictors—such as tumor size, grade, lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, and age—and evaluate how these features relate to whether a patient is classified as Alive or Dead. After cleaning the dataset by removing duplicates, dropping biased or redundant features, and encoding categorical variables, we performed visual and statistical analyses to uncover key patterns. The results show that survival is influenced by multiple interacting factors rather than any single dominant variable, and low-dimensional UMAP projections confirm that Alive and Dead cases overlap substantially. Overall, this project establishes the foundational business understanding and data insights needed to prepare the dataset for the next phase: building predictive models that can help identify high-risk patients earlier and improve clinical decision-making.
